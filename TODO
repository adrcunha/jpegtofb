Remove default error handling in libjpeg (necessity reduced as I have
implemented pre-load checks to reduce the likelihood of passing a broken JPEG
to libjpeg)

Improve the interpolation when scaling. And by "improve" I really mean
"implement"

If the source image and framebuffer dimensions have have the same exact size,
skip the scaling phase altogether, and save memory.

Fit width as well as height

Recurse directories?

Fade/crossfade between images
