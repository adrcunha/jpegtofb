Write man page

Remove default error handling in libjpeg (necessity reduced as I have
implemented pre-load checks to reduce the likelihood of passing a broken JPEG
to libjpeg)

Improve the interpolation when scaling. And by "improve" I really mean
"implement". Doing this in a way that can handle large images on
Raspberry Pi-type hardware, without taking a week, will be non-trivial

Recurse directories?

Consider adding transition effects between images
